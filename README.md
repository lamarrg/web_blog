This is an app that is a portion of the Udemy class, https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-web-course-learn-by-building-8-apps

It focuses on using Flask to build an API.

Items/Frameworks used:
* Python
* Flask
* MongoDB
* pymongo
* Jinja2

The course has been completed. I varied a thing or two. At this stage of my learning, I am a fan of using external databases rather than creating the database on the same server. (Part of that is because I do not want to clutter my system. I can create virtual environments in Python, but not with database installs, they are system wide...)

I set up a free version at [mlab](mlab.com), ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?jmp=nav) also offers a free sandbox, but I already had an account at mlab.)
